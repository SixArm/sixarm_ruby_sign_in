Sign In simple abstract framework.

You can include this module in your application controller,
then your controller can define any of these concrete methods. 

This provides one top-level method:
  sign_in(options=nil) => true for success, false for failure

The top level method will call mid-level methods
that you will define in your own controller.

sign_in calls:
  sign_in_attempt(options=nil), e.g. authenticate and set current user
  sign_in_success(options=nil), e.g. redirect to a welcome page
  sign_in_failure(options=nil), e.g. flash notice help messesage

== AuthLogic Example

AuthLogic provides this example:
  def create
    # sign in attempt
    @user_session = UserSession.new(params[:user_session])
    if @user_session.save
      # sign in success
      redirect_to account_url
    else
      # sign in failure
      render :action => :new
    end
  end

AuthLogic example refactored for improved security and structure:

  def sign_in_attempt
    @user_session = UserSession.new(params[:user_session])
    @user_session.save
  end

  def sign_in_success
    redirect_to account_url
  end

  def sign_in_failure
    render :action => :new
  end
